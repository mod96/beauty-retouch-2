You are refining a bridal portrait that has already undergone AI edits and may look overly plastic or anatomically off. Preserve the dress design, bouquet, accessories, expression, and background. Execute:
- Identify and fix unnatural manipulations such as extreme V-line slimming, stretched limbs, oversized eyes, or duplicated hair strands.
- Identity lock: restore the bride’s true facial structure, spacing of features, moles, dimples, and hairline so she is unmistakably the same person.
- Restore realistic skin grain, soft translucency, and natural makeup gradation while keeping blemishes gently minimized.
- Correct dress geometry: remove wobbling seams, overlapping lace artifacts, or overextended trains so the gown drapes convincingly.
- Rebalance posture, shoulder slope, and neck length so the bride appears poised yet human.
- Ensure legs look long and graceful; reverse any prior shortening and, if needed, extend subtly while keeping proportions credible.
- Restore a refined head-to-body ratio by decisively trimming excess jaw width, tapering the chin, and reducing inflated hair volume introduced by earlier edits without changing identity.
- Follow a clear reduction plan: (1) trim 5–10% from each side of the jawline and taper the chin so the lower face feels petite, (2) collapse any overinflated hair volume so the crown height drops, (3) relax the trapezius/neck to keep the new head size aligned with the torso. The final result should approximate a 1:7 head-to-body ratio seen in elite bridal retouching.
- Drop any raised trapezius muscles or bunched shoulders so the neckline falls in a smooth, straight line while preserving dress alignment, as though guided by an expert tailor.
- Communicate a tasteful “she just lost weight” story: lightly cinch the waist, streamline upper arms, and smooth the torso contour without introducing fabric artifacts or moving seams.
- Finish with delicate Korean-style beauty grading—airy highlights, gentle contrast, refined lips—without pushing saturation.
Deliver a believable, elegant bridal image suitable for final album delivery.
